# React + Vite

"A simple quote generator project. You need to enter a single word into the input field, based on which a single quote will be generated. There is a file in the `src` directory named `readme.txt` where more than 50 words are written. You have to pick one word from it and enter it as an input in the input field. Then a quote will be generated with the author's name."


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
